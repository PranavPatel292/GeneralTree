# GeneralTree
A program for creating a General Tree.!

A General Tree is a tree with no limitation or bound on the number of children a parent can have like in a Binary Tree (A Binary Tree can have almost two-child per parent node). So, the construction of the General Tree becomes a bit difficult as you have no idea of how many children a parent node can have.
